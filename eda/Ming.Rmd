## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
donors <- read.csv("data/donors2.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
donors[, 1:3] <- sapply(donors[, 1:3], as.numeric)
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
donors %>%
    gather(key,value, Living, Deceased) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=value, colour=key)) +
    geom_line() +
    ylab('Counts')+xlab('Year')+ ggtitle("Number of Donors by Year") 
    
```

# Throughout the last 20 years, there is this growing trend for both types of the donor. The number of deceased donors has been gradually increasing. As for the number of living donors, there are waves of decreasing around 2010, nevertheless, it has a total increase of more than twice comparing to the past. Based on the survey, more people through out all age-groups have heard of, or willing to donate their organs, however, there is only 10% of them who would do it after there deaths. This is worth a deeper investigation because it does not fit with neither the steady growth of deceased donors nor the out-number of living donors by deceased donors.
