# Distribution of Variables

In this graph, we see the total of donors from 1988 to 2020 in 9 age groups. The bar graph shows the range from 1988-2020 throughout each age group. From the graph, we see that the most organ donations came from people in the age range of 50-64 years old. The age groups with the fewer donations besides the Unknown, are <1 and 1-5 years old.
